This directory contains the source code of the Ups debugger.
This file describes what ups is, what it runs on and how to build
and install it.  The file CHANGES in this directory summarises
the changes between this release and previous public releases.


WHAT IS UPS ?
=============

Ups is a source level C and C++ debugger that runs under X11
or SunView.  Fortran is also supported on some systems.
It runs in a window with two major regions: one showing the
current state of the target program data and the other showing
the currently executing source code.  A key feature of ups is
that the variables display is persistent: when you add a variable
to the display it stays there as you step through the code.  The
current stack trace (which function called which) is always visible.

Ups includes a C interpreter which allows you to add fragments
of code simply by editing them into the source window (the source
file itself is not modified).  This lets you add debugging printf
calls without recompiling, relinking (or even restarting) the
target program.  You can also add conditional breakpoints in a
natural way - you just add a statement like "if (i == 73) #stop"
at the appropriate place in the source window.

Some things you can do with ups:

   + Add variables to the display by simply clicking on them
     in the source window.

   + Expand (recursively) structures and unions to show their
     members.
	
   + Assign to variables by editing the displayed value.

   + Add breakpoints by pointing with the mouse at the line
     where you want execution to stop.
	
   + Add interpreted code at any breakpoint, including code that
     calls compiled functions and assigns to variables.

It's hard to describe an interactive application in a few paragraphs of
text - the best way to see what ups is like grab a copy and try it.
There's a walkthrough debugging session in the manual page: if you work
through this and aren't hooked at the end of it then I'll give you
your money back :-)


HOW UPS DIFFERS FROM XXGDB, XDBX AND DBXTOOL
============================================

The key implementation difference between ups and the various X front
ends for dbx and gdb is that ups is not a front end for a command based
debugger.  Xdbx and xgdb give you a convenient way to invoke the
underlying debugger's commands, but it is fairly clear in both that
you are talking to a text based debugger.  Ups in the other hand is
a complete native debugger implementation; there is no underlying
command language.

An example: to print the value of a variable in xgdb you select (by
dragging) a variable name and then click on `print' in the menu.  Xgdb
passes the print command with the selection to gdb and displays the
result.  By contrast in ups you click the mouse over a variable name
and it is added to the display.  Once the variable is added to the
display it stays there, so you can watch it change as you step through
the code.  If the variable happens to be a structure or a pointer to a
structure you can `expand' it to show its members.  Again, the
structure members thus added remain in the display until you get rid of
them so you can watch their values change as you execute the code.

Of course there is a downside to not talking to an existing debugger: you
lose portability.  Ups is machine dependent - a port to a new architecture
is a significant effort.  I think the benefits outweigh the cost.


SUPPORTED CONFIGURATIONS
========================

The current list of supported configurations is:

	Architecture		OS version		
	------------		----------		
	SPARC			Solaris 2.X, Solaris 7, Solaris 8
	SPARC			SunOS 4.X
	Intel x86		Solaris 2.X
	Intel x86		FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x (ELF)
	Intel x86		Linux 2.2.x (ELF)

These older configuration should still build and run:

	Architecture		OS version		
	------------		----------		
	Intel x86		FreeBSD 2.2.x (a.out)
	Intel x86		FreeBSD 3.x (a.out)
	Intel x86		Linux 2.0.x (ELF)

Ups also contains code for the following configurations, but they are
unlikely to build or run without some work:

	Architecture		OS version		
	------------		----------		
	Sun 3			SunOS 4.X		
	Sun 386i		SunOS 4.0.X		
	DECstation		Ultrix 3.X and 4.2	
	Intel 386		BSDI BSD/386 0.9 Gamma	
	Sony NEWS (MIPS)	?
	MIPS Magnum 3000	RISC/OS

Ups has also been ported to the Sony NEWS (MIPS) workstation (by Nobuyuki
Hikichi) and to the MIPS Magnum 3000 (by Hal R. Brand and Conor Doherty).
I have folded these changes into the code but I don't have access to the
machines to test them directly.

Frank Gifford <giff@eng.us.uu.net> has been working on porting ups to 
BSD/OS.  The last ups port was around BSD/OS 1, this is for 4.0.1.  
Currently it works for Intels, and he is in the process of getting it to 
work for Sparcs.  To get the README.uunet file for information and mailing
list details specific to ups on BSD/OS, see ftp://ftp.eng.us.uu.net/pub/ups

Back in ups version 3.14 one could optionally build ups using a modified
version of gdb (version 4.13 - see README.gdb for details).  This is now
broken - any volunteers to fix it ?


SUN SPARCompiler SC 4.0 and 5.0 SUPPORT
---------------------------------------
(contributed by Russ Browne)

For best results on Solaris, compile UPS with the SC4 C compiler, or the SC5
C compiler if you have it.  If you later upgrade to the SC5 C and C++
compilers, re-run the configure script and rebuild UPS with the new compiler.
This allows UPS to use the demangling libraries supplied with the compiler.
Choice of compiler has no effect on support for gnu or centerline compiled
code, or on C code compiled with SC4/5.


FreeBSD 3.x a.out SUPPORT
-------------------------

The simplest way is to build an UPS which can debug 'a.out' executables
using
    ./configure --enable-aout

To build an 'a.out' format UPS executable is more involved :
1) Put copies of crt0.o and libgcc.a from 2.2.8 in /usr/lib/aout
2) Run
    OBJFORMAT=aout CFLAGS='-L/usr/lib/compat/aout -L/usr/X11R6/lib/aout' \
	./configure
3) Run
    OBJFORMAT=aout make
4) Use 'ldd' to check UPS will pick use libraries from "aout" directories.

Both methods worked with FreeBSD 3.2, but the first is much simpler.


FORTRAN
=======

Ups has Fortran support on the Sun 3, SPARC and Intel x86, but this is not
as stable or complete as the C support.  GNU Fortran (g77) is supported, with
some restrictions.  Similarly, 'f77' calling 'f2c' (e.g. on FreeBSD 2.x).
See the file BUGS for known problems and work-rounds.


INSTALLATION
============

Ups should be reasonably simple to install.  It has no library files,
just a binary and manual page.  You can put the binary and manual
pages where you like.  There is no need to be root to do any part of
the installation (although you must obviously have permission to
create files in the directories where you put the binary and manual page).

When building with gcc on Solaris, make sure the gcc version is 2.8.0 or
higher.

If you want to build ups for more than one architecture, compiler or
operating system from a single source tree unpack the distribution
as described in step 1 below then read the file README.multiarch for
instructions.

To build the native version, follow these steps:

1)  Unpack the distribution. You should have a compressed tar file called
    ups-3.XX.tar.gz (where 3.XX is the version number of the release).
    Change directory to a disk with a three or more megabytes of free
    space and say:
 
        gzip -dc ups-3.XX.tar.gz  |  tar xfp -
 
    If you have GNU tar say:

	tar zxfp ups-3.XX.tar.gz

    If the 'p' flag produces errors then don't use it.
    This will create a directory tree called ups-3.XX.  Change directory
    into it.
 
2)  Run the 'configure' script:

	./configure

    Please see INSTALL for details on the 'configure' script and the
    options it can take.

    NOTE - if you have several compilers on your system you can ensure
    the appropriate one is used by setting the CC variable in the shell,
    e.g. to use the SunPro ANSI compiler on SunOS 4 type:

	CC=acc ./configure

    The ups specific options to configure, and their defaults. are listed
    below.  You would not normally need to use them.  Disabling multi-screen
    support may speed up redrawing the ups window on some systems.
    The 'gets()' routine is a security risk so the interpreter omits it as a
    hint you should rewrite your code to use 'fgets()'.
    The '--enable-aout' and '--enable-elf' options are only of use on FreeBSD
    systems that support both formats.

      --enable-multiscreen    allows the '-split' option to put each window
				 on a different X screen [yes] 
      --enable-clibrary       C library routines in the C interpreter [yes] 
      --enable-gets           gets() routine in the C interpreter [no]
      --enable-math           math library routines in the C interpreter [no] 
      --enable-longlong       allow 'long long' in the C interpreter [no] 
      --enable-longdouble     allow 'long double' in the C interpreter [no] 
      --enable-aout           debug 'aout' executables [guessed] 
      --enable-elf            debug ELF executables [guessed] 
      --enable-debug          [no] 

3)  Check the files created by 'configure' in this root directory :
	Makefile  ifdefs.h

    In the Makefile check, and edit if required :-
    
    - "X11_INC = ..." line includes the directory for the X header files
    - "X11_LIB = ..." line is correct for your X libraries

    - On Solaris 2, if you are using SPARCcompiler C 2.0.1 or less,
      the line "CFLAGS = ..." should include "-g -DSVR4"

    - If you are using a MIPS RISC/os machine, uncomment the SUBMAKEFLAGS
      line for RISC/os.

    You might also want to edit the Makefile if you want to change
    the default locations of the installed binary and manual page,
    or special flags to to compiler.  However this is best done by
    giving options to the 'configure' script.  These are described in
    the INSTALL file.

4)  Just type:

	make  ups

    If all goes well this should build you a binary called ups/ups.

    If you want you can experiment with ups at this point.  The manual
    page (in ups/doc/ups.man) has a "GETTING STARTED" section which
    should get you going.

5)  To install ups and the manual page type:

	make install

    By default this will install the program as /usr/local/bin/ups and
    the manual page as /usr/local/man/man1/ups.1.  On Solaris the files
    will usually be /opt/bin/ups and /opt/man/man1/ups.1.

    If you want to set the owner and/or mode of the files then set shell
    variables BINARY_OWNER, HEADER_OWNER or MANPAGE_OWNER to the required
    parameters for the (BSD) install program, e.g.:

	BINARY_OWNER='-o root -g wheel -m 444'  make install
 
    If you don't wish to run "make install" (or it fails) you can install
    ups simply by copying the binary and manual page into place.

6)  Optionally copy the Ups resource file to the 'app-defaults' directory.
    In X11R6 this is usually /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults; for Solaris
    CDE systems, it is usually /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults. In earlier
    X releases it is /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  You can also
    set the shell variable XAPPLRESDIR to point to your own 'app-defaults'
    directory.  Alternatively just use the values in your own resource file.

7)  If you want to build the stand-alone C interpreter type:

	make  interpreter

    If you want to build the med3 menu editor (edits ups menus) type:

	make  med3

    There are some simple programs to test ups with, type:

	make  tests

    and look at tests/README

8)  If you want to rebuild with a different compiler, such as clcc, go to
    main directory and type:

	rm config.cache ; make clean ; CC="clcc -Xa" ./configure ; make

    An alternative method is to build into a different location, see
    README.multiarch for details.

USEFUL BITS
===========

Things you might find useful (despite the lack of documentation):

ups/ci_*.[cy]	A reasonably complete ANSI C interpreter.  There are many
		details that it gets wrong (e.g. the exact type of integer
		constants and the subtler aspects of typedefs).  There is
		a test driver in ups/cx.c.  The grammar is in ups/ci_parse.y.
		This was derived from the grammar at the back of K&R2.

ups/as_*.c	Disassemblers for the 68020, SPARC, VAX and MIPS chips.

lib/libmtrprog/genmergesort.h
		A macro to implement a merge sort function for any linked list.

lib/libukcprog
		Various low level routines that aren't in the standard
		C library.

lib/libarg	General purpose command line parsing, including filename
		globbing and I/O redirection.

lib/libedit	Emacs style editing in an X window

One day I might get round to documenting all this stuff ...


RE Y2K ISSUES
=============

Ups makes very minor use of file dates, using the fstat(), localtime(), and 
asctime(() calls. These calls are Y2K compliant as long as the SunOS/Solaris 
Y2K patches are installed.

Russell Browne reported:
  While doing Y2K testing on one of our commercial products
  I put UPS through the same tests and uncovered no problems.
 
This does not constitute a certification that UPS is Y2K compliant in
any legal sense.  As is customary with free software, UPS is distributed
without warranty of any kind.


FEEDBACK
========

I hope you find ups a useful tool.  If you have problems building
or using it, find bugs or have suggestions for improvements please
send mail to the mailing list.  I also appreciate paeans of praise
describing how wonderful ups is :-)

There is a mailing list for discussion of ups and for announcements
of bug fixes and new features.  The list is ups-users@ukc.ac.uk -
send requests to be added to the list to ups-users-request@ukc.ac.uk.

A personal note: I have benefited enormously from free software
that others have contributed (things like emacs, perl, gcc, X and BSD).
Ups is my attempt to give something back.  Long live free software.

17 June 1998
------------
Mark Russell has decided to let the "RGA" contrib release become the 
"official" release, as he is unlikely to be able to work on ups in 
future.  Consequently, I've dropped the `RGA' suffix in this version.
