Changes after 3.38beta2
-----------------------

Changes between 3.38beta1 and 3.38beta2
---------------------------------------

Fixes from Flemming Madsen <fma@ccieurope.com>:

o  With SUN Forte 6.0 C++ structure member names had spurious characters
   at the start as the STABS emitted for them had changed.

o  Automatic variables in files with '.c' extension put through a C++
   compiler not displayed properly.

Enhancements from Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>:

o  Support for wheel-mice and mice with more than 3 buttons.

o  Improve support for bitfields, including 64 bits wide.

o  Various fixes for DWARF 2 support.

o  Import latest 'libdwarf' (libdwarf2003Apr06.tar.gz).

o  Updated the GNU name demangler to the version from the gcc 3.3 release.

o  Fix memory leaks.

Changes from Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk>:

o  Initial support for C++ with DWARF 2.

o  Command line option -[no]findtypes controls whether UPS tries to find
   class definitions using their names if the debugging information is
   not sufficient.  DWARF only.  Default is enabled.

o  -e <entryfunc> option to 'cg' fixed.

From Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>:

  I noticed that you had put in a stub for macro support, with a comment
  that gcc doesn't generate macro data. The latest versions do generate
  it actually, or at least the gcc 3.2 with RH 8 does. You have to use
  -g3 to ask for level 3 debugging information though.

  I did do some work last weekend to get macros working - it's based on
  code we already had that added macro support with stabs using a little
  program we wrote to insert an extra stab for each macro. I've removed
  the stabs specific bit (which is a horrible hack) and added code to
  read the DWARF2 .macinfo section instead. I had to fix a few bugs in
  the macro code in libdwarf first though, which is included along with
  code for dwarfdump to dump macros.

  Macro support isn't perfect - the main problem is the fact that macros
  aren't scoped, so you need to evaluate an expression containing macros
  at a specific line in order to decide what value each macro has.
  Currently it uses the first line of the function if you evaluate an
  expression that includes a macro in a function context. It also doesn't
  support function type macros at all.


Changes between 3.38beta1 and 3.37
----------------------------------

Changes from Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk>:

o  Support DWARF 2 debugging format as used by GCC 3.1 and later.
   Only works for C programs, limited Fortran support, no C++ support.

Enhancements from Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>:

o  Fix a crash if it fails to find a function definition for the target
   address when you step into a new function.

o  Fix some more problems when an target file is reloaded by ensuring that
   everything is changed to point at the new symbol information.

o  Bound issues in some loops that I found by running ups under valgrind.

o  Prevent confusion when you have both a function and a global variable
   with the same name.

o  Get the file descriptor limit right.

o  Allow config loading to occur even if there is no state directory. This
   is reasonable because there may be a ~/.upsrc or something that we want
   to read even if there is no saved state.


Changes between 3.37 and 3.36
-----------------------------
Enhancements from Tom Hughes <thh@cyberscience.com>:

o  The stack and breakpoint listings show object names if source
   file names aren't available.

o  Added watchpoints for x86 machines. They support both real x86 
   hardware watchpoints (where possible) and use of mprotect() to 
   implement watchpoints when that fails. They can be made visible
   on other architectures by using the WantWatchpoints X resource.
   Watchpoints work in some cases on Solaris, but not reliably. 
   If ups moves to the new procfs interface, we could use
   better method provided by the Sun kernel watchpoints.

o  On machines using ptrace, ups blocks correctly now. It uses
   sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp(). Also added code to fix a problem with 
   some X servers that was revealed once it was blocking properly - 
   some X server and/or window managers send us synthetic events that 
   looked like the special end of events event we send ourselves.

o  Fixed some problems with preamble decoding on x86 machines - some 
   tail call optimised routines would confuse it completely and it got 
   the minimum breakpoint address wrong most of the time.

o  Reloading of shared objects which change work properly now. It 
   ensures that only objects which change are reloaded and that we only 
   load each object once at startup instead of twice. It also migrates 
   everything to the new symbol table and discards the old one which 
   fixes all sorts of prolems including memory and file descriptor 
   leaks and the tendency of breakspoints to not appear in the source 
   display after a reload.

o  Vastly improved handling of long long types in expressions. It 
   should also improve long double a bit.

o  A bug fix for my previous patch to add frameless stack tracing on x86.

o  If the ReverseArrows X resource is set, ups reverses the sense of 
   the up and down arrows which are used in an expression or variable index.

o  The address-of and dereference buttons work for expressions as well 
   as variables. This allows one to pick out components of an expression
   from the command line, just as one does with variables.

o  The start button morphs into a restart button if the target is running 
   so that you don't need to kill it and then start it - this has the same 
   confirmation protection as the kill button.

o  File descriptors open on startup now remain open in the target process.

o  Double clicking on a variable in the source window expands or compresses
   the structure as it does in the display window. So you can select and 
   dereference a pointer or struct without having to move up to the stack 
   display.

o  Functions in the target process can be called from expressions in the 
   stack display.

o  Extends the canonicalisation of integer type names to cover long long 
   as well as the other integer types.

o  Fix for parameters which have to be widened when passed from 
   appearing twice in the stack frame - gcc on linux adds
   two stabs for these, one for the actual type in the parameter and one
   for the widened form used when it is passed.

o  Ups saves the terminal state on startup and restore it on
   exit and when restarting the target process. This ensures that if the
   application being debugged changes the terminal state and then exits
   or is killed before restoring it the terminal is put back in a sane state.

o  Fix for a crash when dealing with void types with gcc on linux.

o  Optimized the redraw routines by using clipping so that ups doesn't flicker 
   like mad when you drag a window across it.

o  Fix for single stepping across shared library boundaries on x86 machines.

o  Ups checks the dynamic linker cache when it is trying to work out which 
   shared library will be used. Without this it was getting confused about 
   which C library was being used because it wasn't implementing the same 
   search rules as the dynamic linker. The patch also implements DT_RUNPATH 
   (for those systems that support it) from the dynamic section in addition 
   to DT_RPATH so that the search rules should now exactly match those given 
   in the linux manual page for the dynamic linker.

o  Allows main() to be in a shared library.

o  Fix for x86 machines to allow backtraces to be generated even when 
   functions do not have frame pointers by searching back through the 
   stack for plausible return addresses that appear to point after 
   call instructions.
o  Fix to deal with the fact that linux does not provide signal handler 
   information in the ptrace user area by looking in /proc for it instead. 
   This means that ups will correctly stop when it encounters a segv and 
   the target process has not got a handler installed for it. This also
   allows ups to stop on any signal which we have asked to stop on, even 
   if we were single stepping when it was caught. 

Changes from Rod Armstrong <rod@san-jose.tt.slb.com>:

o  One can direct ups to use its own colormap rather than use
   the default colormap. Use this if ups complains that it failed to 
   allocate some colors. This is a particular problem if one uses
   netscape 6 on an 8 bit frame buffer machine, as netscape assumes 24 bit 
   color and corrupts the default colormap. Set the WantInstalledColormap 
   X resource to "yes" if you want ups to use its own colormap. The 
   command line options of -install or -noinstall can also be used.

o  Fixes for editing of long breakpoint names: names are left justified
   rather than right, so the edit point matches the text. Overflow
   dots are shown at the right. Both breakpoint and object names
   resize as the window width changes.

o  Allowed a double click on a variable in the source window to
   alternately expand or compress the variable, just as it does in
   the display window.

o  Fixed the address calculation for pointers to Fortan arrays.

o  Extended the use of the repltab file for all expressions, not just
   those automatically pasted from the source window. In addition, if
   a ./ups-state/repltab files does not exist, ups looks for
   $HOME/repltab as well. If a repltab file is found ups does 
   replacements as specified in the file for text of expressions.
   See the man pages for details. A simple repltab file is:
       NULL 0
       FALSE 0
       TRUE 1

o  Eliminated the messages at invocation for loading stripped libraries
   ("Warning: no .symtab section ... using .dynsym instead"). The 
   messages still appear when loading libraries interactively.

o  Various fixes to allow ups to survive bad code in expressions,
   particularly when calling functions.

o  Fix for using state and breakpoint files with overloaded
   methods. The files now contain the mangled function name followed by the
   demangled name in double quotes. The latter is for readibility only. 

o  Defaulted the ScrollDelay to 25 instead of 0.

o  Fixed the "unknown type 200" messages when reading the symbols of a 
   target buit with Forte 6.1 under Solaris 8. There may be other problems 
   with Solaris 8 however.

o  Fix to enable ups to compile for 64 bits under Solaris 8. This is
   just a start so others can try and get it working for 64 bits. Use
   CC="cc -xarch=v9 -DOS_SUNOS_V9 -I/usr/include/v9", run ./configure,
   then manually change the HAVE_GETC_HELPER and HAVE_PUTC_HELPER defines
   in ./ifdefs.h to 0 before the make.

o  Added a "Drop state" item to the target menu.
   This simply deletes the temporary state file that ups
   uses to save information about breakpoints and what data have
   been displayed during a previous debug session. If you have previously
   attached to a process, and have been looking at global variables
   that take some time for ups to find, you can stop the debugger scanning
   again for the variables on reattaching to a rebuilt target by using
   the drop state button when unattached. You may also want to use it when
   attaching to a different process.

o  You can now recover from a bad "jump to here" selection. If you try
   to jump to an invalid context, such as trying to jump up the stack,
   the "Stop" button will be active. When stop is pressed, the process 
   will be restored to the state before the jump.

o  Fixed a crash that happened when bad breakpoint code was loaded from
   a breakpoint file, and then ups attached to a process. 

Changes from Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk> :

o  Fixed demangling of Fortran names to cope with the single and double
   underscores added by GNU f77.
o  Fixes for watchpoints on FreeBSD.
o  Changes to the Fortran stuff in the 'tests' directory.
o  Fix for the testwn.c wn library testing file.
o  Moved the GNU C++ demangler out of ups/ao_symscan.c into a new
   directory lib/libgnu and added the demangler for GCC 3.x. 

Changes from Russ Browne <rbrowne@ncplus.net> :

o  Fix for the <Bad format hint> problem seen with g++ on 
   Solaris 5.6 as reported by Will Dowling.
o  Fix for the "sizeof(bool) inconsistent across compile modules"
   warning as reported by John Utz and Zhidian Du.

o  Changes from Terry R. Friedrichsen <terry@venus.sunquest.com>
    - look for '.upsinit' file in current directory before $HOME

o  Changes from Giuseppe Borzì <gborzi@ieee.org>
    - more idiomatic RPM specification file and other RPM stuff


Changes between 3.36 and 3.35
-----------------------------
o  3.36 has been used on Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4.3.1 and Linux Debian 2.0.34
   only.  Built and minimal testing on FreeBSD 3.2, 4.3 and 5.0-CURRENT.
   Being based on 3.35, it should be possible to build it on Solaris 8,
   FreeBSD 3.x, FreeBSD 4.x and RedHat Linux 6.2.

o  The changes to ups make it more versatile and faster to use. It will
   continue to work as before, but for large targets, it is more efficient
   to load just a few standard libraries and load others on the fly as
   needed.  This can be done with a ".upsinit" file in your home directory.
   An example is:

	load *libc.so*
	load *libC.so*
	load /usr/lib/lib*
	load /usr/openwin/*
	load /usr/platform/*
	load /usr/dt/lib/*
	# for target specific libraries:
	load ./*
	load ../*

   You might want to edit this to always load certain libraries, and add 
   source paths with the "use" command, but now there should be little need 
   to deal with this file as libraries can be easliy loaded interactively.

   By using "load" rather than "noload", ups won't be affected by different 
   sets of libraries that each target may have.

   Note that "./" now has the meaning of the directory of the target, not of
   where ups was started.

o  By only loading the minimum standard libraries, ups will start a
   lot faster. Other libraries can be loaded on the fly by selecting 
   "Target", then "Load library", which will display a menu of unloaded 
   libraries - simply choose one to load it. Similarly, the stack trace will
   display <full library name> for an unloaded library. To load it, select
   the line and press "Load library". As always for objects in the display
   window, multiple objects in the stack can be selected at once, and 
   loaded as a group.

   The full set of libraries that the target uses is determined
   after the target has been started or attached to, so the "Load library"
   list will change at that point.

o  Ups is now persistent - that is, it can be kept running for weeks
   like an editor, with no need to exit at the end of each debug
   session. The top line of the "Target" line can be edited to a 
   different name, and ups will read new symbols as necessary and 
   reinstate breakpoints and variables as possible. So if you are
   working on a shared library, and you need to test it with 
   different targets, simply enter the new target name and 
   attach, and the debug state information will be preserved.
   (The unimplemented "Write target core" was changed to "Load library").
   The target name accepts csh style tilde notation.

   Similarly, one can continue to debug code that gets built each
   night by a nightly build: detach before the rebuild, then
   reattach afterwards and ups will read any newly built libraries and
   restore the debug state. There should no longer be problems with 
   reverse video caused by the debugger not updating its symbol information.

o  It is now easier to use ups to examine code. Left clicking
   on a function name in an active function causes ups to read the
   function symbols before navigating to the function. You can bypass
   the symbol reading by using the middle mouse button. So an 
   unmodified left click looks up local symbols, then globals, a 
   shift-left click does an automatic "add expr", and a middle click,
   if not over breakpoint code, looks up global symbol lookup only.

o  Fixed a refresh bug when using CDE with "click to focus" and "raise on
   focus" - ups now repaints properly when it receives focus.

o  Changed the submenu order when loading breakpoint files so that the
   default is to save the breakpoints to the statefile.

o  Changes from Terry R. Friedrichsen <terry@venus.sunquest.com>
    - Fixes for building on Red Hat Linux 7.0

o  Changes from Russ Browne <russ@amc.com>
    - Changes to the menu editor (med3) to produce readable output.

o  There are new X resources for the "Load library" menu invoked from the
   target line: UnloadedLibMenuForeground and UnloadedLibMenuBackground.


Changes between 3.35 and 3.34
-----------------------------

o  Changes from Russ Browne <russ@amc.com>
    - Support for SC5 compiler:
        Use the compiler supplied demangling library.
        Recognize the bool type, now supported by this compiler.
        Support for new implementation of virtual base classes used
        by this compiler.

    - Corrected look and feel for X clipboard operations:
        Selected text does not vanish when the mouse button is released.
        Instead, it stays selected until another clipboard selection
        is made or the displayed text is changed by some user action.

        Corrected paste from X clipboard to not allow pasting a new-line
        in a text display that does not accept a new-line from the keyboard.

    - Corrected display of source files with dos style line endings to not
      display the \r at the end of each line.

    - Added a keyboard history feature:
        Most regions where UPS accepts data from the keyboard have
        a history of recent entries.  Recent entries can be accessed
        either through the keyboard by typing Control-P or Control-N,
        or through the mouse by pressing a button that brings up a menu
        of recent entries for that item.

    - Added a text-entry button.
        This was primarily so that when entries are accessed through
        the history menu one can complete the entry with the mouse
        rather than shifting to the keyboard to type return or escape.
        Clicking the middle mouse button on this region does a paste.

    - Allow the user to remove the mousehole from the display through X resources.
        If one uses a large font, the typing line area can get
        rather small.  By setting X resources one can retrieve the
        space the mousehole takes up for the typing line instead.

    - Fixed med3 keyboard routines to recognize the most useful control characters.

    - display of 'long double' on SunOS 4.x
    - implement raise/lower on "exec to here".
    - fix to the symbol table problem reported by James Armstrong.
    - stop 'Add Expresion' crash if no debugging info in the file
    - fixes for lower/iconify on run

  Notes from Russ Browne <russ@amc.com> :

   Added X resource and command line option to split the output window
   off as an independent top level X window.

   Arrange that ups can raise itself to the foreground when the debugged
   process breaks or dies.  This behavior can be turned on by a
   menu option under "Windows" (below) or by an X resource or a command
   line option.

   Renamed the old "Snapshot" button to "Windows" and added options to
   raise sister ups windows to the foreground and to make ups raise itself
   to the foreground when the debugged process breaks or dies.

  Some more technical changes:

    Added handling of N_ILDPAD stabs information in elf symbol tables.

    Further tightening up of compiler identification while handling
    the N_OPT stab.

    Treatment of SC5 virtual base classes is working to my satisfaction.
    I removed from the CHANGES file the sentence about this requiring
    a lot more work.

    In split window mode, the typing line '/' and '?' shortcuts always
    search something on the screen where the command is typed.

    Changes in symbol parsing to ensure the the va_type field in
    a var_t object is never NULL.  I reported earlier that I changed
    TypeID to never return NULL; that proved to be a mistake.  Instead,
    I always check that the "rtype" being assigned to v->va_type is
    not NULL.

    Removed the broken mousehole from the source window when it is
    split off a top level window.

    Renamed the X resource to remove the mousehole completely to
    "WantMousehole=no".

    Added X resource and command line option to turn message logging
    on by default.

    Added wn_setdefault() and used it to set several X resources
    from the command line.  X resources so treated appear in the
    command line as [-[no]option], so that an option turned on by an
    X resource can be turned off by the command line, or vice-versa.
    These options are:
       -[no]split[:num] -[no]splitoutput[:num]
       -[no]mousehole -[no]outwin -[no]logging -[no]raise_on_break

    Added support for menu toggle items and used them to combine the
    message logging on/off options into a single option and to add
    the new raise-on-break option.

    When the window containing the display area is iconified all UPS
    windows are iconified.  When that window is de-iconified all windows
    iconfied with it are restored.

    Gave UPS an icon.  As I said earlier, I not a great artist.
    If anyone wants to improve on my work, or replace the icon
    completely, be my guest.  The bitmap for the icon is in ups.c

    Added X resources for the source and output window geometries.
    These are Src.Geometry and Output.Geometry.  Originally, these
    were to be SrcGeometry and OutputGeometry, but the '.' fell out
    of the existing get_xdef routine in wn_init.c and appears to be
    consistent with X conventions for specifying a resource specific
    to an individual window, button, or the like.  In the manual page
    I spelled this out as "Ups.Src.Geometry" because I felt readers
    might not understand that the "Ups." still goes in front of the
    resource name.

o  Changes from Rod Armstrong <rod@san-jose.tt.slb.com>
    - splitting the ups window into two.
    - X resources to control vertical positioning of the items in the
      display window.
    - fix for static globals with Centerline and Purify on Solaris.
    - fix for scroll delay code
    - revived the code for debugging dynamically loaded libraries.
      This was commented out in 3.35 beta6 because it caused a step 
      in C++ code to be very slow. The hit should happen now only
      when the dynamic linker does a load, open or close of a 
      dynamic library, or when the user rescans the init file.
      Ricardo Telichevesky <ricardo@teli.org> reports this works
      on Linux Red Hat 6.2 as well as Solaris.
    - related to the above, rescanning the init file now works again.
    - for a display window search, optimized the coloring by turning 
      it on and off only when necessary. This reduced the setup time 
      for a search from minutes, for a display window of thousands of 
      lines, to millisecs.
    - fixed a bug that caused most steps to behave like nexts in Sun
      shared libraries, especially for C++ code.
    - added support for displaying Static members of a class for 
      Centerline compiled code.
    - added /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults to the search path for X resources.

o  Changes from Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk>
    - support of multiple X screens in libx11wn.
    - various FreeBSD and Linux bugs.
    - 'C' library calls in interpreted code at breakpoints on Linux
      and FreeBSD 3.x,4.x.
    - fixes for lower/iconify on run
    - application defaults file may be in /usr/X11R6/lib/...
    - stuff to allow a FreeBSD package/port of ups to be built
    - libx11wn builds in its directory and not the X11 subdirectory
    - stuff to allow a Linux RPM of ups to be built

o  Changes from Panagiotis Tsirigotis <pgttso@best.com>
    - fix for UPS crash when using a g++ that generates vtable thunks
      for virtual function dispatch.

o  Changes from Peter Collinson <pc@hillside.co.uk>
    - control speed of scrolling of text in windows with Ups.ScrollDelay

o  Bob Carragher <bob@fla.fujitsu.com> and
   Rick Mallett <rmallett@ccs.carleton.ca> tested the 'split windows'
   code on dual-monitor systems.

o  Doug Hughes <Doug.Hughes@ENG.Auburn.EDU> provided fixes for
    -  Makefile errors.

o  Dibyendu Majumdar <dibyendu@mazumdar.demon.co.uk> provided fixes for
    -  memory leaks in the interpreter code.
    -  make C interpreter understand class::method so can be used in
       interpreted breakpoint code.

o  Thanks to Laszlo Ladanyi <ladanyi@us.ibm.com> for pointing out
  - UPS was using its own 'strstr()' when most C libraries now have one,
  - 'gets()' should be avoided
  - not necessary to remove "-O2" when building using 'gcc'


Changes between 3.34 and 3.33
-----------------------------

o  Rod Armstrong <rod@san-jose.tt.slb.com> provided fixes for
     -  debugging core files under Solaris 2.6 and 2.7. For Solaris,
        from limited testing, debugging target and cores is summarized below:

	UPS Built     Can debug targets from        Can debug cores from
        on Solaris    2.5    2.6    2.7             2.5    2.6    2.7 

        2.5           yes    no     no              yes    no     no
        2.6           yes    yes    no              no     yes    no
        2.7           yes    yes    yes             no     yes    yes
 
    -  files created with a custom preprocessor inherit the 
       dereference semantics of the language of the output files:
       e.g. if "file.c-custom" is processed to "file.c", then the
       C semantics of "->" and "." will be used when clicking on 
       variables.
    -  Globals should show their correct type instead of sometimes
       showing "int assumed". The bug was introduced in 3.33.
    -  The "Stop" button once again terminates a long symbol table search. 
       The bug was introduced in 3.33.1.

o  Russ Browne <russ@amc.com> provided fixes for
    -  breakpoints in static constructors
    -  compiler identification
    -  changes to g++ 2.8.1 symbol table
    -  using UPS on purify'd executables
    -  locating X application resources file
    -  display of 'register' storage class variables
    -  latest version of GNU C++ name demangler
    -  A Dump Memory item which can be used to show the contents of a 
       section of memory in bytes, shorts, longs and ascii. 

o  Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk> provided
    -  building UPS through a 'configure' script
    -  changes for FreeBSD 3.x (a.out and ELF)
    -  fixes for Fortran on FreeBSD and Linux

o  Michele Ferlauto <ferlauto@athena.polito.it> provided sample
   programs and did testing for the GNU Fortran fixes on Linux.

o  Laszlo Ladanyi <ladanyi@watson.ibm.com> provided fixes for
    -  building under debian Linux 2.0 (kernel 2.0.35)
    -  building on Linux with glibc 2.1
    -  ELF symbol table processing on Linux
    -  compilation warnings

o  Dibyendu Majumdar <dibyendu@mazumdar.demon.co.uk> provided
    -  lots of work on the standalone C interpreter included in the
       UPS source code, documentation on it, tests etc.  See the file
       interpreter/docs/Interpreter.txt for full details.

o  Will Renkel <rinky@lucky22.chi.il.us> provided the information
   about building UPS on a Linux 'a.out' system (on the web site)


Changes between 3.33 and 3.32-RGA 
-------------------------------------
   Russ Browne <russ@amc.com> added handling of symbol table information 
   concerning base classes, vector tables, and static class members in 
   SC4 and g++ object files.  This results in the following family  of 
   features, most of which work only for the above two compilers:

o  Base classes are displayed as structs within the structure,
   similar to ddd or Visual C++.

o  Static members of a class may be examined in a way consistent
   with the UPS methods for  examining of global data ( e.g. click
   on "myClass::statMem", or for examining members of a struct
   (e.g. select an object of type myClass* then enter ".statMem"
   in the typing line, or click on "statMem" inside a NON-static
   method for myClass to get this->statMem).
       
o  Added a popup menu option to expand all static members of a
   selected object.

   He also:

o  Moved the determination of the compiler to the initial load of the symbol
   table instead of the parsing of type information.  This should remove the
   need for the UPS_COMPILER environment variable as a workaround for when
   the previous algorithm failed.  Also, the compiler is correctly identified
   before it is needed during demangling.

o  Fixed some ommisions in the demangling. ( Gnu distructors demangled
   as A::_ instead of  A::~A; for SC4, operator*= and operator%= demangled
   as operator-=; for SC4 and clcc, cast operators demangled incorrectly.)

o  Added handling of template type names in g++ symbol tables.

o  Put up a blocking cursor (hourglass) during symbol table parsing as
   version 2.XX did.

o  Corrected "Unknown PT_NOTE type " message that
   came up when loading an ELF core file.

o  Various fixes to better read static variables, both local and global,
   for SC4 code.

o  Improvements to handle optimized code. This should result in being able
   to set breakpoints on the open brace of functions in optimized code,
   and result in the stack trace when you break in optimized code (or
   get a core file for one), showing all optimized functions as being
   at their opening brace.  Better than not shown at all.

o  Corrected the following in 3.32:

       Default colors for "HighlightColor" and "VariableColor" failed
       if these X resources were not set.

       Using the typing line shortcut to do a search then shifting
       to the search button in the menus to continue the search
       dumped core.

       With g++ version 2.6 and earlier, variables of type bool
       could incorrectly display as true.

o  Jody Goldberg <jodygold@sanwafp.COM> contributed a small fix for
   the hashtable growing algorithm. This addresses a failure on large 
   C++ programs under Solaris-2.5.1

   Rod Armstrong added:

o  Fix to allow debug of a target that is completely statically linked.

o  Fix for cleaning up the temporary breakpoint file that UPS creates
   when re-attaching to a different instance of a process.

o  Fix so that that when multiple instances of local or global variables
   are displayed (by using the duplicate option for instance), all
   such instances are restored when the function is re-enetered.
   Previously only one instance was restored.

o  Updated the man pages and online help text.

o  Added the source for the med3 menu editor. The old sources were made
   ansi compliant, and the editor now reads and writes the expanded menu
   structures that include the foreground and background colors that
   were introduced in UPS version 3.32. The med3 sources are in the 
   ups-3.33/med3 directory. There is documentation in ups-3.33/med3/doc.
   Med3 was written by John Bovey, UKC, 26-4-93, who also did most of
   the development of the wn library. Med3 links with the wn library in
   the UPS distribution. I restored the autonomy of the this library by 
   replacing all hardcorded calls to other ups functions with callbacks.


   The following were in the 3.32.1 patch and are included in 3.33
   ---------------------------------------------------------------

o  Fixed the problem of finding source files for targets that are relatively
   linked. This bug was introduced in the 3.32 version, and only appeared
   for certain combinations of compilers and source.

o  Fixed the menu colors for the "*" menu item for variables. There is
   now a special Asterisk resource for this. See the man pages for details.

o  Fix for finding symbol table information in library object files produced by
   the SC4 compiler, that are statically linked into the target.

o  The temporary file that ups uses to re-establish breakpoints on
   reattaching to a target is now named with a PID number, and removed
   after use. This fixes possible file conflicts between different users
   on the same machine.

o  Fixed a crash reported by Bob Carragher <bob@fla.fujitsu.com> caused by
   an old state file that referred to a data structure that had since changed.

o  A left click on a block in the stack (the line that shows the line
   ranges for the block) now displays the source, instead of expanding the
   block.

o  Fixed inefficient repaints for target menu, and made the stop button
   active during all symbol table reading.

      Incorporated patches from Ian Edwards <ian@panorama.com> for:

o  Fixing build problems with FreeBSD 2.2.6-STABLE (also thanks to 
   Terry R. Friedrichsen <terry@venus.sunquest.com>). 

o  This also restores the ability to call target functions from breakpoint
   code. Should work for Linux as well.

o  Fix for FreeBSD in which doing 'Stop', 'Kill', 'Start' caused 
   "Fatal internal error: shared lib botch (aborting) ...".

o  FreeBSD - when debugging a core file UPS now reports the signal that
   caused the core dump, and the stack trace includes symbols that are
   in shared libraries.

o  General - can now edit long long integers.  Tested on FreeBSD 2.2.6-STABLE
   and Solaris 2.


Changes between 3.32 and 3.31-RGA 
-------------------------------------
   Mark Russell has decided to let this contrib release become the "official"
   release, as he is unlikely to be able to work on ups in future. Consequently,
   I've dropped the `RGA' suffix from this version forward.

   I've updated UPS with some nice enhancements contributed by Russ Browne
   (russ@amc.com) as listed below. I added a useful "Jump to here" feature,
   and fixes for true color visuals, and additional colors for menus and text.

o  Double-click and left-shift-click do the same thing whereever possible,
   except where indicated below where this was not possible.

o  Added X Resources to control the multi-click timeout value.

o  In the upper (display) window, arranged that a double click or 
   left-shift-click selects the same accelerator for each object type.

o  Enhanced the above accelerators as follows:

      For a variable or expression:
        If the variable is a struct or struct*, expand or collapse it
        as before,

        If the variable is a pointer to some other type, and not fully
        dereferenced, increase the level of dereferencing.

        If the variable is of integer type, or a fully dereferenced pointer
        to an integer type, toggle the format between unsigned hex and
        signed decimal.

        This results in shift-clicking on an expression doing something
        useful most of the time.

      For a breakpoint object:
        Added an X resource to control the preferred accelerator.  Choices
        are to remove the breakpoint, as ups currently does, or to 
        toggle the active/inative state of the breakpoint. The default 
        action is to toggle the breakpoint state, rather than to delete 
        the breakpoint.
  
      For the breakpoint header object
        Added an X resource to control the preferred accelerator.  Choices
        are to add a new breakpoint as ups currently does, or to toggle
        the global enable/disable state. The default is to toggle
        the global state.

o  A disabled breakpoint is displayed grayed out in the source window.

o  When breakpoints are globally disabled, the active/inactive
   states of breakpoints are grayed out in the objects window to give
   visual indication of the global state, and all breakpoints are
   displayed grayed out in the source window.

o  Double clicking on a breakpoint in the source window
   selects the same accelerator as double clicking or shift-clicking on
   the breakpoint object in the display window.
   Shift clicking in the source window adds an expression, as before, and
   does NOT select an accelerator.

o  Added X resources to control the default behavior of the source window
   pop-up menu.  The options are:
  
       Remember the last selected option as the default, as ups currently
       does.
  
       Make any of "add breakpoint", "execute to here", or "edit file" the
       default.

       In addition, make any of the above an alternate default selected by a
       shift-right-mouse-button click.
  
       Cause a selection with shift-right-mouse-button to change the default
       option in addition to selecting an option, as ups currently does
       with with a plain right-mouse-button selection.
  
o  When the call editor option is used, and the editor is vi, display the
   file name in the xterm title bar.
  
o  Added the following typing line "shortcuts":

   %g name

           Displays the global variable or function name, skipping the
           sometimes expensive attempt to display name as a local variable.

   %b function

           Adds a breakpoint at function, same as clicking on the
           breakpoints header, selecting "add breakpoint", and typing
           the name.
  
   %l file
           Lists file, if file is one of the files in the source file list,
           the same as expanding the list and clicking on the file name.
           One types only the final component of the file name.

   /pattern or ?pattern

           Begins a forward or backward search for pattern in the source
           window, as in vi.  The search may be continued in the same
           direction by hitting return, or in either direction by using
           the search pulldown menu.

o  Corrected a bug where attempting to edit the value of a byte or short
   sized parameter fails.

o  Added a command line option to force ups to pass the full name of the
   target executable as argv[0] for the process, rather than truncating
   it to the final component only.  This is useful for debugging programs
   that use the path to themselves to locate resource files, or when
   the program is purified and wants to process itself on startup.

o  Updates and corrections to the man pages and on-line help.


   The following contributed by Rod Armstrong:

o  Fixed a makefile problem on Linux that caused "make" to try and
   build a bogus target after having made the ups binary.

o  Custom menus now support meta keys using `@' to denote a meta
   key. This allows editing of text using entities of words.

o  Added a "Jump to here" option in the source window menu.
   This causes the target execution to jump to the current line
   without executing any intervening code. Use this with caution as it
   is possible to jump to a bad context where the data is bad or where there
   is no valid call stack. The safest usage is to jump over lines
   within a function. It can also be used to jump back within a function.

o  Fixed color problems with true color displays. Ups should no longer 
   emit warnings about bad parameters for X protocols. As a corollary of
   this, I added the ability to use extra colors for all menus, and text
   in the display window. 

o  The old problem that caused ups to switch to monochrome when other color 
   intensive applications such as netscape were present is gone. If ups 
   cannot allocate private color cells with adjacent planes, it switches to
   using publically allocated colors. Ups required cells with adjacent planes 
   in order to do logic operations such a reversing colors and shading. It
   now uses colors for the same effect if it can't obtain such cells.

o  New X resources allow you to color menus and text. (If you don't 
   want the new colors, set WantMenuColors and WantExtendedTextColors to "no".)

      WantMenuColors
	   If set to `yes', ups will use foreground and background
	   menu colors as listed below. If not set to `yes', such
	   settings are ignored, and the Foreground and Background
	   resources are used.

      MenuForeground, MenuBackground
	   The default colors for text and background in all
	   buttons and menus. Sub menus inherit the colors of their
	   parents unless specifically overwritten.

      DisabledTextColor
	   The color for text that is disabled, such as the
	   `start' caption after starting the target, or globally
	   disabled breakpoints.

      LastButtonTextColor
	   The text color of a busy button pressed (such as `cont'
	   while the target is executing) or the parent menu item
	   of a sub menu.

      SourceMenuForeground, SourceMenuBackground
	   The text and background colors of the pop up menu for
	   the source window.

      CustomMenuForeground, CustomMenuBackground
	   The text and background colors of the custom pop up
	   menu for editing text strings.

      FileBoxMenuForeground, FileBoxMenuBackground
	   The text and background colors of the pop up menu for
	   the file name and line number box that is directly
	   above the source window.

      <text caption>Foreground, <text caption>Background
	   The text and background colors for a menu item with a
	   specific text caption: for example "Add breakpointForeground". 
	   Note that imbedded spaces are allowed.

      WantExtendedTextColors
	   If set to `yes', ups will use the colors for the text
	   items in the display window as listed below. If not set
	   to `yes', such settings are ignored.

      SignalTextColor
	   The text color of the signals listed under the `Signal'
	   header.

      EnvironmentTextColor
	   The text color of environment strings listed under the
          `Environment' header.
 
     SourceFileTextColor
          The text color of the file names listed under the
          `Source files' header.
 
     FunctionTextColor
          The text color of the function names in the stack under
          the `Functions' header.
 
     BreakpointTextColor
          The text color of active breakpoints listed under the
          `Breakpoints' header. Inactive breakpoints are in the
          main foreground color, as is the text of breakpoint
          code in the source window.

o  The distribution includes a sample apps-defaults file (Ups) that 
   illustrates the use of such resources. It could be installed as
   /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Ups. 

o  Fixed a bug that broke the "Rescan Init File" option and automatic
   rescan of the init file on a reattach. Also fixed unnecessary reloading
   of shared libraries on a reattach.

o  Added a workaround for a symbol table bug seen with the patched
   Centerline compiler on Solaris. Ups now emits a message of the form
   "unmatched N_BINCL symbol in <library> (<file>)" and continues rather 
   than exiting as before.


Changes between 3.31-RGA and 3.29-RGA 
-------------------------------------
   This is mostly a bug fix release. Support for gcc/g++ (including version
   2.8.0) is much improved, and crashes when loading Sun SC4.2 compiled
   code have been fixed.

o  Fixes for reading SC4.2 code, mainly C++. 

o  Many fixes for g++ to fix crashes on reading the symbol tables.
   All data members of structs and classes should be displayed now -
   previously these were often truncated. For g++, C++ name demangling 
   conforms to the gnu style - for example a template method might be shown
   as "array<array<int> *>::operator[]". 

o  UPS allows spaces in function names as shown in the above example. 
   State files and breakpoint files now enclose function names in
   double quotes for this reason. However UPS will happily read old
   style control files without quotes.

o  There is no longer shell style globbing for breakpoint names. This
   makes it easier to enter special characters such as brackets in operator 
   methods. One could enter "ostream::operator<<" to break on cout
   statements, for instance, without having to escape the "<" characters
   as previously. Name completion works as before. 

o  Provided a workaround for a problem in debugging shared libraries
   with the Rational Clearcase source control file system. There is a
   mismatch between the Clearcase virtual file system and the Solaris
   /proc virtual file system such that UPS could not debug shared
   libaries that were in a versioned object base or vob. UPS now figures 
   out the mapping between the file systems and debugging can proceed.

o  UPS understands the data type "bool" that gcc supports. Data of 
   type bool is shown as "true" of "false" in the display window. It 
   can be edited to be either such string, or an integer - 0 being displayed
   as "false" and all other values as "true". In breakpoint code, it 
   should be assigned to an integer.

o  UPS will load a dymanically loaded library that occurs during a "next"
   or "step" operation as well as during a "cont". Previously it worked
   only for "cont".

o  Fixed a bug when reattaching to a process that is stopped at a pause().
   Previously the first attach left the target at the pause, but the
   second attach broke it out of the pause.

o  UPS should digest the occasional bad section of symbol tables without
   croaking. A few bad stabs entries have been seen on some Solaris Centerline
   compiled code. UPS will emit "Bad syntax in symbol table" and continue.

o  Added a new help section under Help -> Breakpoints -> conditional.

o  Minor updates and corrections to the man pages.


Changes between 3.29-RGA and 3.28-RGA 
-------------------------------------

o  Incorporates a native port for Linux ELF. Testing done on 
   Linux 2.0.27 from RedHat. One cannot debug core files at present.
   Attaching to a running process works, though the stack trace
   is truncated and one cannot do a "next" directly. Instead,
   set a breakpoint in the source after the attach point and "cont" -
   the the stack will right itself.

o  Includes support for"long long" and "long double" data types from 
   Ian Edwards <ian@concerto.demon.co.uk>

o  More fixes for SC4.2 code, mainly C++, and minor fixes for g++.
   This includes all patches previously posted to the UPS mailing list.
   Fixed problems with endless complaints and beeping about "can't open file"
   and "too many open files" for some targets. Source file listing now
   includes all files that UPS knows about. Can now read classes defined
   within classes for SC4.2.

o  An "execute breakpoint" no longer deselects the breakpoint. One can
   now repeatedly execute some breakpoint code by re-pressing the
   execute caption. A useful application is to indirectly bump a
   symbolic subscript in an `add expr' by incrementing the symbol
   in breakpoint code.

o  Static destructors are labelled "__STATIC_DESTRUCTOR" in the stack.


Changes between 3.14-beta and 3.28-RGA
--------------------------------------

o  UPS now supports C and C++ code for SC4, SC4.2, gcc, and
   cfront. There are some limitation: template classes cannot be debugged
   and the symbol table reading for g++ is not complete. 

o  Incorporated patch from Ian Edwards <ian@panorama.com> for FreeBSD 2.1.6.
   The changes may have broken support for BSDI/386 (if it was working).

o  You can now debug static constructors in C++ code that get called
   before the start of main(). Simply put a breakpoint on the constructor
   and run the target. The routine above the constructor in the stack
   (labelled "__STATIC_CONSTRUCTOR" for SC4 and cfront) locates the
   object instance in the source.

o  Fixed problem about breaking out of a pause on Solaris. Note that due to 
   an apparent Solaris bug, the debugged code needs to setup a dummy 
   signal handler for SIGCONT for a pause to work. That is:

	static void dummy_cont(int sig) {}
 	main()
	{
	   signal(SIGCONT,dummy_cont);
	   pause();
	}

o  For Solaris only, UPS will now detect the dynamic linking that takes place 
   when the target calls the dynamic linker routines such as dlsym(). The new 
   library will be loaded at that time, and breakpoints re-established in the 
   new library. There shouldn't be any problems about reverse video, and
   mismatched source and libraries. This works even when the breakpoint is in a 
   library that changes name after calling dlsym().

o  Eliminated spurious messages about unknown type in stab.index 
   when debugging binaries linked with Purelink.

o  You can now re-read your `~/.upsinit' on demand during a debug session 
   by selecting the `Target' object and selecting the `Rescan init file' 
   caption. This is convenient for adding new source paths or loading
   additional libraries on the fly. A missing library is indicated by the 
   stack displaying a `<bad text address ...>' symbol, as well as the files 
   of such libraries not being shown in the source files listing. After 
   the rescan, the source files and stack are redisplayed to reflect the new
   libraries and source paths. As before, the file is always read during an 
   attach. However, the new method allows you to update the debugger without
   losing control of the target by detaching.

o  The "Step" button behavior is much improved. In the previous patch, the 
   step action used heuristics, based on function names, for stepping into
   and within shared libraries. A similar scheme was used for stepping
   into C++ method calls. The step action is now much more reliable,
   and the improvement is most apparent on Solaris and for C++ code.
   It handles macro calls properly. The older step action worked by 
   disassembling the object code to determine where to place a 
   temporary breakpoint, and then ran the target to that point. The 
   new method single steps the target at a low level, and at each point
   checks to see if the target is in a known source file, and uses this to
   determine whether to stop or not.

   Because this technique is based on where the target actually 
   jumps, rather than where it is expected to jump, the new step behavior 
   may get occasionally get interrupted by a signal, such as a
   an authorization check that runs at intervals. If this happens, 
   click on the routine above the signal and press step
   again to resume the step action.

   Occasionally the step action may take some time - however the "Stop" 
   button can be used to break out of such a situation. If you don't 
   want to step through the code of called functions in this way, use 
   the "Next" command. This behaves like Step, except that it never steps 
   into called functions.

   The improved step behavior has eliminated the need for the step
   menu that appeared over the step button when debugging C++ code. 
   The man pages and on line help have been updated to reflect this.

o  UPS automatically changes to process frameless functions 
   if it detects the presence of Purify, Purecov or Quantify.
   This will fix the stack display, and the step action reverts to the
   older heuristics scheme. A value of `off' for the NonFrameFunctions
   X resource explicitly overrides such automatic setting.

o  The activation state (active or inactive) of breakpoints is
   now maintained when saving and restoring breakpoints.

o  When loading breakpoints from a file, a submenu now offers the
   choice between saving such breakpoints in the statefile or not.
   Previously, breakpoints loaded via a file were not saved in the
   statefile.

o  Fixed a bug whereby a breakpoint entry was cleared if the text included
   embedded wildcards.

o  Fixed bug on Solaris whereby the debugger would not appear to stop
   on a breakpoint unless the mouse cursor was over the debugger window.

o  Ability to make a X selection (cut & paste) in the display window.
   Left button selects objects for operations as before, and one can pan 
   vertically to select groups of objects. If the horizontal
   distance from the original click exceeds a certain value, the window
   shifts from selecting objects to making an X selection. the value is
   30 pixels by defaults, but can be set with the SelectionThreshold X
   resource. One can easily just pan right to select a string for instance. 

   If the selection in the display window begins outside of an object, 
   text will be selected immediately. This makes it easy to select a 
   stack trace for example, by simply panning vertically down the
   leftmost column.

o  A new button above the display window allows a search on text in the 
   display window, in a similar manner to seaches in the source and output
   window.

o  Restored ability to make a text selection within breakpoint code. Click
   on the line, but outside the text to select the breakpoint with
   highlighting in the display window.

o  Eliminated second appearance of custom menu when used in the display
   window to insert text.

o  Fixed compile problems in o.def.c and ui_layout.c.

o  Fixed bug for displaying globals using the "file-name:global-sybol"
   syntax in the typing line. This was broken for files that contained
   global data, but no functions. In general: if the global-sybol
   is a variable, the variable is added to the display; if it is
   a function, the source window will display the code. 

o  Previously, when you clicked on a global, UPS sometimes displayed
   a bogus entry rather than the real instance of the variable. The bogus
   entry had an invalid address; hence its value did not change at the
   code was executed. With this version of UPS, such cases will
   cause two entries to be displayed - of which one may be bogus.

o  Symbol table fixes for SC3/4, g++ and cfront/clcc. There are still 
   problems with SC4 in reading classes that refer to forward declarations 
   of other classes - such classes cannot be expanded. 

o  C++ demangling for SC3/4 and g++.

o  Fixed fatal problems for large cfront C++ targets stemming from source 
   file renaming.

o  Save and load of UPS state on demand. This is accessible by selecting the 
   target name at the top of the display region.

o  Fixed next and step for SunOS shared libraries.

o  Fixed editing of long fields in the display window. Affects target
   name and arguments, environment strings, and global and local
   variables. Editing fields now correctly resize when the tool is
   resized.

o  It is safe to make references to shared library code before attaching.
   If UPS is invoked on a target without specifying a PID in the
   command line, it is now safe to set breakpoints in shared libaries,
   or otherwise view shared library files. It the debugger is then
   attached to a target, the shared library symbol tables will be 
   rescanned and any breakpoints in the shared libaries will be
   reinstalled.

o  The reload file function now works correctly, and breakpoints in reloaded
   files are maintained.

o  Fixed function block line numbers for shared libraries for SunOS. 
   This also fixes a bug that breakpoint code couldn't see variables in
   function sub-blocks in shared libraries.

o  Added step sub menu for cfront compiled C++ code.

o  Added a help button. This is to the left of the Snapshot button.

o  Can now select "a -> b" with a left click. Previously, such
   selections did not work when spaces were present.

o  Restored ability to toggle selection of breakpoints in the display
   window with right button.

o  Fixed fatal "attempt to reference nonexistent object" condition
   when removing a selected list of breakpoints that that contain
   automatic duplicates due to multiple linking.

o  Any "add expr" code in functions can now use file types. Previously,
   file types were available only if a local variable referred to them.

o  Long variable names are no longer truncated in the stack display.

o  Restored behavior so that shared libraries are pre-scanned before running 
   the target.

o  Restored blocking for C++ code.

o  Only file names are shown in the source file list, stack, and source
   window label - sometimes path was also included. Eliminated files with
   the same name and path from the list, other than multiple linked files.

o  Tilde notation allowed on file reads and writes. Applies to breakpoint
   files, state files. output window loads and saves and writing target cores.

o  Fixed blobs left on screen when moving cursor in breakpoint code. This
   only affected some fonts, such as 16pt fonts.

o  Globals are automatically restored when using a state file.

o  Cannot detach if already detached (this caused a crash).

o  Fix for some SunOS shared libraries functions in which UPS could not 
   read any variables.

o  Fix so that tracking breakpoints in multiple linked files change together
   when breakpoint code is used.

o  Restoring breakpoints in multiple linked files from a breakpoint file,
   or from a state file, or by a "break name" statement in a ~/.upsinit
   file installs the tracking breakpoint as well.

o  Restored the prescan of dynamic libraries, before the target is run.
   This allows you to set breakpoints and see files of dynamic libraries
   before the target loads them.

o  Search for globals stops on the first exact match. For targets that have
   many globals scattered in hundereds of files, this reduces the search
   time from many minutes to a tens of seconds.

o  When UPS is reading symbols, the `Stop' button becomes active while
   the adjacent buttons become inactive. Pressing the button will stop
   the symbol reading at the end of the current file or function. 

o  If the UPS window is exposed of resized while it is reading symbols,
   it will be promply repainted as required.

o  Automatic duplication of breakpoints for C++ to catch overloaded methods.

o  Automatic deference of the "this" pointer when clicking on names in C++ code

o  Messages when symbols for functions are read in.

o  Motif type scrolling direction if desired.

o  Will quit when a window manager sends a WM_DELETE atom, whether
   running or stopped.

o  Autoscrolling on selecting text in the display window.

o  Varible names are colored.

o  Breakpoint code is colored.

o  Different default color for breakpoint code and changed values.

o  Added attach and detach buttons.

o  Added Activate, Inactive and Execute buttons for breakpoints.

o  Acclerators for the display window (SHIFT-left mouse button):

o  Added a menu item in the source window to spawn an editor.

o  Custom menus, including control character support, are available for 
   the typing line, display, source and output windows. See the section
   on "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AFFECTING UPS" in the man pages for details.

o  Left click on breakpoint code in soure window highlights breakpoint
   line in display window, (as did previous versions of UPS).

o  ESC/RET do partial name completion when setting breakpoints.

o  Shift-ESC, or Shift-RET, list options in output window. When multiple matches
   are found, the message indicates that Shift-ESC can be used to list
   the matches, without terminating the edit.

o  Includes enhancements from Russ Browne, Applied MicroSystems (russ@amc.com) 
   for the UPS_FORMATS environment variable, and bumping of array indicies 
   on duplication, and elastic formating of file names in the stack and 
   breakpoint list. The formating feature allows the file names to be 
   visible for large fonts, and when the debugger window is made quite narrow.

o  Incorporates fixes from Daniel M. Quinlan (danq@lemond.colorado.edu) for
   displaying structures and unions, some fortran variables and a fix for 
   "unknown type" in scanning SC4 symbol tables.

o  Includes enhancements from Callum Gibson (callum@bain.oz.au) for
   the save state code for signals.

o  A fix for 16bpp visuals was contributed by Craig Amey <craiga@MetaSW.COM>.

o  Added global enabling and disabling of breakpoints.

o  Breakpoints which are inactive or globally disabled run at full speed.

o  Added NonFrameFunctions X resource for fixing stacks for Purify/Quantify.

o  Fix so targets using shared libraries can be debugged from other
   directories.

o  Added `Add source path' to source file header.

o  Added a menu for files, functions and the file name box to show
   file paths and reload and rematch files.

o  Added control of logging of messages to the Snapshot menu.

o  Added `Collapse -> First level/Completely' sumbmenu to 
   source file header.

o  Added VERBOSE environment variable. Can be 1, 2, or NOLOAD.

o  Added init file support: use, load, noload and break. Also record file syntax.

o  Added rescan of initization file on reattach, so libaries can be loaded, if
   initially NOLOAD.

o  Added -nosavesigs to command line.

o  Added RWCString under Formats -> other

o  Signals setup control if target is killed on getting SIGSEGV or SIGBUS, and
   if such signals can be passed to the target and allow debugging to continue
   (for ObjectStore typically).

o  Support for multiple linked files.

o  Default outwin is about 10% instead of 30% height.

o  Fix so breakpoint code at first breakpoint works.

o  Updated man pages and CHANGES to included features of this patch.

o  Included the Linux port done by Rick Sladkey (jrs@world.std.com)
   for version 2 of UPS some time ago. Version 2 only supports the 
   older "a.out" binaries, not the newer "ELF" binaries that Solaris and 
   Linux now use.

   It is included in this version as a starting point for someone to port
   UPS to Linux with ELF. It should be simple to get it working for a.out
   targets; elf targets will require more work, but as this version has
   elf support for Solaris, it should not be too onerous. If anyone
   does a port, I'll be happy to include it in my next patch with appropriate
   acknowledgment.


Changes between 2.45.3 and 3.14-beta
------------------------------------

 - Solaris 2 support

	Ups now works under Solaris 2, with either gcc or the Sun
        SPARCompiler version 3.  It can read symbol from .o files, so
	you do not need to compile with cc -xs.


 - Gdb based support

	Ups can now be build using a automatically modified version of
	the GNU gdb debugger.  See the README file for the precise
	instructions.  Basically the process is:

		- unpack, configure and build gdb

		- run a shell script which builds a symlinks copy of
		  the source tree, munges the gdb source file there,
		  then builds libgdb.a from the munged source files

		- run make in the top-level directory to build ups
		  using libgdb.a for the debugger functionality.

	I have built ups under HPUX and IRIX using the gdb
	support.  Canned support for these and other architectures
	will be included in a future release.

	You can build ups on Solaris 2.3 and SunOS 4.1.3 using the native
	support (again, see the README file for details).  It is also
	possible to build the gdb based version on these systems but
	there is not much point doing this.
	
 - Emacs-like key mappings

   	You can use most of the common emacs key mappings when editing
	text (e.g. in the typing line, when adding breakpoints etc).
	See EDITABLE FIELDS in the manual page for details.

		  
 - Cut and paste

	You can select text with highlighting in the source window,
	the output window and in fields you are editing.  To select
	text, press the left mouse button and drag.  Releasing the
	left mouse button sets the X selection and clears the
	highlighting.

	You can paste text into an edit with control-Y (currently you
	can't paste with the mouse - this will be done soon).  In the
	source window there are some extra shortcuts:

	       - pressing and releasing the left mouse button (without
	         dragging) adds a variable name to the display as in
		 previous versions of ups.  Only if you move the mouse
		 to a different character with the left button down do
		 you get a plain X selection.

	       - doing a press-left-and-drag selection with the SHIFT
	         key pressed automatically pastes the selected text as
		 an expression into the appropriate place in the stack
		 trace.  It is equivalent to selecting some text,
		 selecting `add expr' for the appropriate entry in the
		 stack trace, pressing ^Y to paste the text and
		 hitting RETURN.

	      -  If you hold the shift key down, the press and release
		 the left mouse button without moving the mouse, ups
		 adds the expression under the mouse to the display
		 area.  It makes a reasonable attempt to select what
		 to display.  Try it out to see what I mean.

	See PASTING EXPRESSIONS FROM THE SOURCE WINDOW in the manual
	page for more information.
	
	
 - State save and restore

	 If the file ups-state exists in the current directory, ups
	 will write state information to it when you exit, and reload
	 state when you start.  This includes breakpoint locations
	 (and the interpreted code, if any), and the state of the
	 variables display.  See SAVING STATE in the manual page.


 - Loading and saving breakpoints

	You can explicitly load and save breakpoints to files.  To save
	breakpoints, select one or more in the display area, then
	select `save' from the menu.  You will be prompted for a file
	name.  If the file already exists you will be asked whether
	you want to cancel the save, overwrite the file or append to
	it.

	Saved breakpoints can be reloaded by selecting `Load' from the
	`Breakpoints' header menu.


 - Editing in the output window

	You can now edit in the output window (the window where
	$printf output goes.  Click with the middle mouse button to
	display a cursor.  You can then append or delete text.  This
	is useful for tidying up output to make it clearer, or for
	deleting uninteresting stuff.

	You can also dump objects (like the stack trace) to the
	output window (the `Snapshot' menu item to the left of `Quit'),
	and save or restore the output window contents from/to files
	(`Load' and `Save' in the output window menu).

  - Code in header files

	Ups now handles code #included from header files.

  - Plus various other things, which will be described in the full
    release.
