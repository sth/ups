# 	UPS Frequently Asked Questions
# 	------------------------------

Q: Why can't I invoke UPS without any arguments and then instruct it to
   debug a program?

A: UPS was designed from the start to get its target name from the command
   line. You can also supply the target arguments on the command line
   with the "-a" option. See <<<UPS Command Line Arguments>>>.

   You can also add or edit arguments within UPS by editing the 
   target text at the top of the display window. See
   <<<Target Command Line Arguments>>>. You can also attach and detach to 
   specific instances of the target from within UPS via the attach and 
   detach buttons - see <<<The Source Region>>>.
   
Q: How can I cut and paste text in UPS?

A: Pan with the left mouse button down to select text, and ^y to paste the 
   text selection in. See the <<<Cut and Paste>>> section for details.

Q: I have a very large program and UPS takes forever to come up. Can
   the speed be improved?

A: UPS does a prescan of global symbols and addresses on invocation.
   This allows you to put breakpoints in shared libraries (such
   as printf in libc) before the libraries are actually mapped in.
   An application may use dozens of libraries, but typically you are
   only interested in debugging a small set. You can tell UPS not to
   load any symbols for specified libraries by using the noload or load
   statements in a ~/.upsinit file. In this way the invocation time
   can be dramatically reduced. See the <<<Initialization file>>> for 
   more details. Unloaded libraries can be interactively loaded on
   demand with the "rescan init file" caption in the target menu.

Q: I want to see how some data in heap changes from one point to another. If 
   I click on such a variable where it is created, it may be out of context 
   and not displayed at another point. How can I make the display permanent?

A: Place an "add expr" high up in the stack (such as "main"), or in a source
   file where the data type is used. The expression should be a typecast of 
   the variable address to the right data type. For example, for a variable
   displayed like 

	struct func_s **<p_initfunc>      0x14d56c

   the expression would be "(struct func_s **)0x14d56c". The expression can 
   be expanded, and cont pressed. Then when UPS next stops, either at a 
   breakpoint or by pressing the stop button, any changed data members 
   will be shown in the highlight color (default is red). 

   In most cases you can copy the variable line in the display window, click 
   on the function name, press add expr, then paste and edit the string  
   with this custom menu string:

	# this is to change a variable to an `add exp' of the address
	setenv UPS_F5_STR "^y@b^ @b^w^b^d)^a(\n"

Q: The pause() instruction in my program no longer works in Solaris. Why?

A: The pause() functionality in Solaris is different from SunOS. In order
   to make pause() work, you need to add a dummy signal handler for
   SIGCONT for a pause to work. For example:

	static void dummy_cont(int sig) {}
	main()
	{
	    signal(SIGCONT,dummy_cont);
	    pause();
	}

Q: My program has the dummy signal handler for SIGCONT, and it is stopped
   at a pause(), but when I attach UPS, why does the stack show 
   <bad text address>?

A: The symbols for the C library are not loaded. Check your ~/.upsinit file
   for statements like "noload *libc*".

Q: The scrollbars work in the opposite direction from what I expect. Can
   this be changed?

A: Yes - set the ScrollbarType X resource to anything other that UPS, such 
   as MOTIF. Then scrolling will move the viewport in the opposite direction 
   to the mouse movement, this being the convention used by most X toolkits.
   See the <<<X Resources>>> section.

   One might point out that the industry standard for this is contrary to 
   the action of a real scroll of paper, in which the viewport remains fixed
   and the paper in moved through the viewport onto the rollers. The UPS
   scrollbar emulates moving the paper with the viewport fixed: other
   scrollbars apparently suggest keeping the paper fixed and moving
   the viewport.

Q: Can I position the scrollbars on the right, instead of the left?

A: The undocumented SHIFT+CONTROL with left/right button combinations can do 
   this. However there is currently a bug in that scroolbars on the right 
   display no elevator blob. 

Q: It is sometimes laborious to expand and collapse objects by always having
   to select them, then move the mouse up to the top menu to perform the action.
   Is there a quicker way?

A: Yes - see the <<<Accelerators in the Display Area>>> section. 
   SHIFT - left click generally toggles between expanding and collapsing
   the object.

Q: My display window often shows too much data. I might be interested
   in seeing just a couple of data components in the third level of
   a nested struct, but expanding the intermediate levels uses too much 
   space and obscures the stack.

A: There are several solutions for this. First, create a ups-state
   directory before invoking UPS, then having displayed the data in the
   desired form, it can be restored in a later session to the "like
   before" state. See the <<<Saving State>> section for details.

   Consider the following example:

      func_t <f{0}>                      *0x1ddfb8
        short <fu_flags>                   0
        char <fu_name{0}>                  "main"
        char <fu_demangled_name{0}>        "main"
        type_t <fu_type{0}>                *NULL
        unsigned long <fu_addr>            458916
        fil_t <fu_fil{0}>                  *0x1dbdc0
           char <fi_name{0}>                  "ups.c"
           char <fi_name_only{0}>             "ups.c"
           char <fi_path_hint{0}>             "/bs/ups-3.31-RGA/ups/"
           char <fi_source_path{0}>           "/bs/ups-3.31-RGA/ups/"
           language_t <fi_language>           LANG_C
           short <fi_flags>                   0
           symtab_t *<fi_symtab>              0x148948
           char <fi_data{0}>                  ""
           undefined struct Srcbuf *<fi_srcbuf>              0x0
           block_t *<fi_block>                0x1dbd98
           funclist_t *<fi_funclist>          0x1ddb00
           fil_t *<fi_next>                   0x1dc628
        language_t <fu_language>           LANG_C
        symtab_t *<fu_symtab>              0x148948
        undefined struct cblist_s *<fu_cblist>            0x0
        func_t *<fu_next>                  0x1dea28
        char <fu_predata{0}>               *NULL
        char <fu_symdata{0}>               ""
        undefined struct statement_s *<fu_statement>      0x0
        lexinfo_t *<fu_lexinfo>            0x0
        lno_t *<fu__lnos>                  0x0
        short <fu_max_lnum>                21331
        block_t *<fu__blocks>              0x0

   When the specific data element appears in the source window, 
   a left click on the text will display just the desired element:
   for instance if "f->fu_fil" appears in the source, a left click on
   the first "f" displays:

         func_t <f{0}>                      *0x1ddfb8

   whereas a left click on "fu_fil" displays:

         func_t <f{0}>                      *0x1ddfb8
            fil_t <fu_fil{0}>                  *0x1dbdc0


   Suppose you are only interested in the "fi_name" and "fi_name_only" 
   members. One method is to fully expand all levels of the struct and then
   select and delete unwanted members. Note that collapsing to the
   "top level" will not delete expanded data members. 

   To eliminate all other data, left click on the "fi_path_hint" line and drag
   vertically down to the "fi_next" line. Be carefully not to stray horizontally
   too far - see the X selection threshold description in <<<Cut and Paste>>>.
   The display window will scroll if necessary. Then press "del" to delete 
   the unwanted data.

   To eliminate data in the "func_t" struct, simply SHIFT-left click on the
   "func_t" line, this being an accelerator for collapsing to the first
   level. The net results will be:

         func_t <f{0}>                      *0x1ddfb8
            fil_t <fu_fil{0}>                  *0x1dbdc0
               char <fi_name{0}>                  "ups.c"
               char <fi_name_only{0}>             "ups.c"

   An alternative is to select the fully collapsed "func_t" object,
   then enter
       .fu_fil->fi_name .fu_fil->fi_name_only <RET>
   in the typing line. This method provides a great deal of flexibility.
   See <<<Examining Linked Data Structures>>>. You can even put such
   commonly used dereference strings in a pop up menu - see the custom
   menu description in <<<Environment Variables Affecting UPS>>>.
    
Q: My program is linked to code that our customers write. It has SIGSEGV
   and SIGBUS signal handlers in order to recover from errors in the
   user code. However when debugging with UPS, the program is terminated
   on a user error, when in fact it is capable of recovering and continuing.
   How can I tell UPS not to kill off the target?

A: See the <<<Special handling for SIGSEGV and SIGBUS>>> section.
   Essentially, the signals should be set to "Stop - accept signal on continue".

Q: Sometimes when I paste expressions into the source area, UPS objects to
   preprocessor macros such as NULL or FALSE. How can I get UPS to understand
   these?

A: Use a ups-state/repltab file to define such strings. See 
   <<<Pasting Expressions from the Source Window>>> for details.

Q: UPS crashes on invocation with my target. Is there anyway to do some
   debugging?

A: UPS has probably encountered some syntax in a library that it can't deal 
   with. A work-around is to not load symbols for such libraries. Set the 
   environment variable VERBOSE to 1 and start UPS again. It should list 
   the library that caused the crash. Then put a noload statement for this 
   library in your ~/.upsinit file, for example: 

                noload *my_library*

Q: How can I see long strings in the display window?

A: There are several methods. You can select the line and use the snapshot
   menu to dump it to the bottom output window which does line wrapping.
   For single indexed strings, you can do a "Dup" which will duplicate
   the string, but with the index bumped by 40. You can also manually
   edit the index to change the start of the string (perhaps using the bump 
   keys - see <<<Expressions in the Display Area>>>). Finally, you can copy
   the text by vertically panning across the line with the cursor to the
   left of the text. It can then be pasted elsewhere, including the
   output window - seee <<<Editing in the Output Window>>>.

Q: I have several expressions, created via "add expr", to view different 
   components of a linked list using the "->[]" syntax as shown below. 
   I can traverse the list by bumping the index, but this only affects the 
   expression I am editing. How can I change many expressions at once?

	root->[0]next->name
	root->[0]next->type

A: If possible, change the expressions to use a local or global variable, such
   as: 

	root->[i]next->name
	root->[i]next->type

   where i is some integer. Then create a scratch line of  breakpoint code 
   to bump its value:

	i++;

   Select the code and repeatedly execute it by pressing the execute caption
   at the top of the display window. This will cause all affected expressions
   to change at the same time. The variable may have to be inialized beforehand
   and reset afterwards - do this by editing the value in the display window.

Q: I am using Purify on my application, and want to repeated call a Purify
   API to check for memory state as I step down lines of source code. How
   can I do this without putting breakpoint code after every line?

A: Use just one line of breakpoint code. Whenever you need to call the API,
   select the breakpoint and press the execute button.
 
Q: I don't want UPS to upset the colormap of my application so I use the -mono
   command line option. However this means that I lose the highlight and
   variable colors. Is there any way to get this information back?

A: The UnderlineVars X resource (see <<<X Resources>>>) can be set to 
   underline variable names. In a later version of UPS you will be able to 
   do the same for data that is highlighted.

Q: How can I make a conditional breakpoint on a 'long long' integer?

A: Because the interpreter does not support long long types, there is a
   trick for making conditional breakpoints for such numbers.  The workaround
   is to use pointers in breakpoint code.  You can check all 8 bytes by
   casting each 4 bytes to a long.  (This assumes the 8 bytes are contiguous;
   works on Solaris, but may not for Linux.)

   e.g. if long long ll = 0x123456789abcdef0
   use this for a conditional breakpoint:

	if (*((long*)&ll) == 0x12345678 && *((long*)&ll+1) == 0x9abcdef0) #stop;

   You could make an editing macro to simplify it:

	setenv UPS_F1_STR '^e^uif(*((long*)&^y)==0x0 && *((long*)&^y+1)==0x0) #stop;'

   1. Create a breakpoint (#stop;).
   2. Select the variable (ll).
   3. Middle click anywhere in the stop line, then right click.

Q: How do I instruct UPS to follow the child process after doing a 'fork()/exec()'?

A: You can follow the child using just one instance of UPS:

   1. Start UPS on the parent:
   
	ups parent &

   2. In the parent add a breakpoint and calls to kill() and printf():

	if ((child_pid = vfork()) == FALSE)
	{                            
	    /* this is the child */
	    ....
	}
	else
	{
	    /* this is the parent */
	    kill (child_pid, 23);       <<< insert this breakpoint code. 23 is SIGSTOP
	    printf ("child pid is %d\n", child_pid);  <<< breakpoint code to get pid
	    ....
	}
	#stop;  <<< stop here to follow the child

   2. At the #stop, edit the target name to the child name, press RET.

   3. Attach UPS to the child <pid>.

   4. From an xterm, continue the child:

	kill -CONT <pid>

   5. In UPS, put a break on main() or whatever, and continue.
