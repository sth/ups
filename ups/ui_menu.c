"\n",
"     This section describes how this state is saved and restored.\n",
"\n",

"          sessions.\n",

"\n",
"     State is saved to the file ups-state/xxx.state, where xxx is\n",
"     the  last  component  of the path of the file you are debug-\n",

"\n",
"     In future releases you will be able to use the .config  file\n",
